## Problem statement

> **It's dinner time ! Create an application that helps users find the most relevant recipes that they can prepare with the ingredients that they have at home**

## Objective

Deliver an application prototype to answer the above problem statement.

By prototype, we mean:
- something usable, yet as simple as possible

We expect to use this prototype as a starting point to discuss current implenentation details, as well as ideas for improvement.
